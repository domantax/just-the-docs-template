We have compiled this information booklet both about the apartment and the local area for your information and further enjoyment of the Costa Calida. This booklet is made more interesting when people add their own information and experiences to it, so feel free to put some leaflets or additional information in the free section at the back. The Costa Calida has a lot to offer, it is all on your door step, just waiting to be explored.

And finally if you are thinking of buying a property here for holidays/investment or retirement, please contact our local agent and the keyholder of this apartment: Maura Dunne, ADS Property. She runs a highly successful property locating business here in the Murcia region:
