# Air Conditioning

This apartment has air conditioning and heating, the unit will always be set to the correct setting for the time of year. The sun setting is for warm air in winter and the snowflake setting is for cool area in summer.

The air conditioning / heating unit can be quite expensive to run: therefore in order to keep our costs down, we would ask you to use it sparingly. If you are using the air conditioning, please remember to close all windows and doors as the system is thermostatically controlled.
